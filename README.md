# PWA-Consultant-Calculator

A simple PWA-based clone of an app called "Consultant Calculator" that, given a subtotal, calculates preset shipping, handling, sales tax, grand total, and commission.

This is a project to hone my skills at PWA development, and put practical products to work using the PWA Starter, showing where it needs to be improved.

## User Features

* Persistent storage of defined shipping rate, handling fee, sales tax, and  commission rate.
* Simple interface.
* No ads.
* No internet connection needed, except to update PWA.

## Development Notes

* Used LocalForage for LocalStorage wrapper.
* Implements Promises.
